# Zim

[Zim](http://github.com/realityforge/zim) is a tool we use to automate changes across multiple
source code bases. The tool allows you to write a small ruby script that makes changes to a local copy
of the source code and push those changes to the remote repositories.

Stocksoftware has integrated Zim into their project workflow. To install it you use [Git](Git.md) to
checkout the source code to zim:

    $ git clone http://github.com/stocksoftware/stock_backpack.git

There is a ``README.md`` in the base directory that gives basic instructions on how to use the tool.
