# Telecube

Telecube service is responsible for managing the 1300 support number that is supplied to our clients when they need
out of business support. This is typically used throughout the fire season on weekends. It is typically configured
by whoever is on Standby to redirect to their mobile phone during the standby period.

To change the configuration of who will received the phone call follow the following steps:

1. Go to [https://manage.telecube.com.au/myaccount/](https://manage.telecube.com.au/myaccount/) and log in. The
username and password are stored in the [KeePass](KeePass.md) file.
2. Click 'Services'
3. Click 'Manage' for the 1300/1800 service.
4. In the 'Simple Routing' section set it up so the person on standby is the 'Primary Answer Point', and the
'First Overflow Point'. Leave the 'Second Overflow Point' to be James' phone. click 'Submit Changes'
5. Test, if you are inclined to do so, by calling the 1300 number.

When you are no longer on Standby it is recommended that you return to the website and re-route the phone number
to the next person on Standby or to James if the Standby period has ended. The numbers for other people are stored
in the notes field in the [KeePass](KeePass.md) file when redirecting the phone number.
