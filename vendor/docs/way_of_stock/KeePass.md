# Installing KeePass

KeePass is an application/app that allows us to store all our Username/Password information.
Add to it if you find any usernames/passwords that are missing and update it when they change.
There is a folder under 'Personal' for each employee. Totally up to you whether you wish to use
this or not but it might be handy if anyone ever needs access to your machine for example.

## OSX

Get a mac friendly KeePass application from <https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass>

## Windows/Linux

Get a windows/linux friendly application from <http://keepass.info/download.html>

## Android App

Multiple applications are available but *Keepass2Android* has been tested and works well.

## Apple App

Personal choice but *MiniKeePass* seems to get a good review.

## KeePass file

Can be found at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BymDQK9P9Ps0UWswcm1KZFJ1WG8>

## Password

Ask someone who knows :-)
